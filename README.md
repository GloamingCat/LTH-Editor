# Lovely Tactics Hex Editor

An editor made in Java to edit the database files from the Lovely Tactics Hex project: https://github.com/GloamingCat/Lovely-Tactics-Hex.

## Installation

* This project is made with IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2023.3.6;
* This project is built upon my other projects LSwing and LWT (which used SWT and Gson libraries). You'll need to pick one of them to add to the Intellij workspace.
  * LSwing (recommended): https://github.com/GloamingCat/LSwing
  * LWT: https://github.com/GloamingCat/LWT
* This project uses my other project Batch Renderer: https://github.com/GloamingCat/Batch-Renderer. It should also be added to the workspace.
* The library GSON 2.2.2 should be included in the project's dependencies.
